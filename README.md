SOLID Principle - c# Example
========================================
SOLID are five basic principles.
- S - SRP ( Single responsibility principle)
- O - OCP ( Open closed principle)
- L - LSP ( Liskov substitution principle)
- I - ISP ( Interface segregation principle)
- D - DIP ( Dependency inversion principle)


S - Single responsibility principle
=================================
A class should take one responsibility and there should be one reason to change that class.

O - Open closed principle
===========================
You should be able to extend a classes behavior, without modifying it.

L - Liskov Substitution Principle
====================================
Principle is related to substitution of child in place of its parent. 
So principle is about relationship i.e. inheritance.

Example : Both LSP implementation & violation available


I - Interface Segregation Principle 
======================================
Make fine grained interfaces that are client specific.

Example : Both ISP implementation & violation available

D - Dependency inversion principle 
=======================================
High level modules should not depend on low level modules but should depend on abstraction.
